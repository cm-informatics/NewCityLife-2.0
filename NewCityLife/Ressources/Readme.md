# New City Life 2.0

### The goal of this App is to allow citizens of a city to report civil issues to make their city a better place to live.
### The citizens can report an issue by taking a photo. Then the grievance must be catagorized and commented if desired.
### The cicil issues will be saved as reports both on the local device and on a webserver where the local city administration has access
### to manage the reports. If enough complaints about a grievance have been collected, the stand management becomes active and eliminates
### the civil issues - as far the idea.

## New Feautres coming soon
### - A map to get an overview where the civil issues have been reported, marked by annotation pins
